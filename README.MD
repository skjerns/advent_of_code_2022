## Runtime statistics 

I did not optimize my code for performance, but here are the numbers on my AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor (of which of course only 1 is used due to the Python GIL) with 3.8 Ghz and 32 GB RAM. Anyway, here are the runtimes. All runtimes exclude the disk reading, but include all the parsing and splitting.
